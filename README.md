# _**Grid-Navigator: A Graph-Theoretic Pathfinding Simulator**_

- A dynamic, interactive web-based platform to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms — including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A* — in real-time.  
- Built with core web technologies and designed to promote deeper algorithmic understanding through engaging, hands-on simulations.

---

## **_Project Overview_**

- **Grid-Navigator** enables users to create custom grids, draw obstacles, set start/end nodes, and watch various search algorithms dynamically explore the space and find optimal paths.  
- Designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world algorithm behavior.

---

## **_Repository Structure_**

- `index.html` — The main HTML file structures the application layout.
- `style.css` — Stylesheet for layout, grid design, and animations.
- `script.js` — Implements the core algorithms and visualization logic.

---

## **_Features_**

- _**Algorithms Implemented:**_
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm

- _**Interactive Grid:**_
  - Draw and erase walls manually
  - Set custom start and end nodes
  - Visual animations of exploration and pathfinding

- _**Controls:**_
  - Dropdown menu to select algorithms
  - Buttons for visualization, reset, and clear

- _**Responsive Design:**_
  - Works smoothly across all modern browsers and screen sizes

## **_Tools Used_**

- _**HTML5**_ — Structure and content
- _**CSS3**_ — Layout and styling
- _**JavaScript (ES6)**_ — Logic and DOM interactions
- _**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**_ — Smooth, performant animations
- _**Canvas API**_ — 2D Grid Rendering and Interaction
