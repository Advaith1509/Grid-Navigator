# _**Grid-Navigator: A Graph-Theoretic Pathfinding Simulator**_

A dynamic, interactive web-based platform to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms — including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A* — in real-time.  
Built with core web technologies and designed to promote deeper algorithmic understanding through engaging, hands-on simulations.

## **_🚀 Project Overview_**

**Grid-Navigator** enables users to create custom grids, draw obstacles, set start/end nodes, and watch various search algorithms dynamically explore the space and find optimal paths.  
Designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world algorithm behavior.
